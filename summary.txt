Susan Hengeveld – a long‑time biologist and saw‑whet‑owl specialist at Indiana’s Yellowwood State Forest – spends each fall night untangling tiny Northern Saw‑Whet Owls from fine mesh nets, banding them with metal tags, measuring them, and releasing them into the darkness.  Her hands‑on work, learned from years of teaching and research on bird song and frog communication, is both a scientific task and a personal rite of passage for the volunteers who get to hold the feather‑soft birds in their palms.  Hengeveld stresses that the value of these efforts lies in the long‑term dataset the banding station generates; only multi‑year records can reveal the true patterns of the owls’ secretive migration.

Through the data collected at Yellowwood and other stations nationwide, Hengeveld and her colleagues discovered that Northern Saw‑Whet Owls are far more mobile than previously thought.  Once believed to be rare and localized to northern winter habitats, the band‑recaptures showed the owls traveling in all directions, extending their range far beyond Indiana each fall.  This insight has reshaped understanding of the species’ ecology and underscored the importance of continuous monitoring, a mission Hengeveld plans to hand off to younger scientists before she retires.

The nightly routine blends meticulous fieldwork with moments of quiet wonder.  After hours of setting nets, listening through hearing‑aid‑aided calls, and checking traps, the team finally captures an owl, which a newcomer—student Grace in the story—gets to release.  The brief encounter—its warm plumage, bright yellow eyes, and sudden plunge into the black forest—captures the fragile connection Hengeveld feels with the birds and fuels her commitment to keep the banding program alive, ensuring that future generations can both study and marvel at these “little owls that teach big lessons.”
